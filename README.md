# Scrimba-Binary_Search_Algorithms
Various approaches to binary search algorithm.

### Standard_binary_search takeaways:
1. Works but leaves room for "off by one" errors. 

### Recursion_binary_search takeaways:
1. Using additional parameters can allow your function to be more flexible. 
   - Use default values to increase flexibility. 
2. Make sure recursion block has a condition to prevent infinite looping.
3. When calling a recursive function make sure the arguments/parameters are different and narrowing in each time. 
4. Recursion can be more DRY but sacrifices readability.
